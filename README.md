## 🩷 Breast Cancer Prediction

I built a breast cancer prediction model using data from Kaggle. I used **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**, both enhanced with **hyperparameter tuning** to boost their performance.

- 📊 **Data**: Includes tumor characteristics like radius, texture, smoothness, etc.  
- ⚙️ **Models**: Random Forest performed slightly better than Logistic Regression.  
- 🧪 **Tuning**: Used `GridSearchCV` for parameter optimization.  
- ✅ **Result**: Random Forest had a small edge in accuracy and generalization.

Built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Jupyter Notebook**.
